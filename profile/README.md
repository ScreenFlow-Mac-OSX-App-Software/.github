## 📊 Overview  

ScreenFlow is a professional-grade screen recording and video editing application designed specifically to help creators produce high-quality tutorials, demos, presentations, and content for online platforms. It combines powerful capture tools with an intuitive editing timeline, making it one of the most efficient all-in-one solutions for educators, marketers, streamers, and content creators.

The recording capabilities of ScreenFlow allow you to capture your entire desktop, specific windows, app activity, microphone input, system audio, and high-definition camera footage—all at the same time. Multi-source recording is synchronized automatically, and users can easily toggle between perspectives or arrange them in the timeline.

Once captured, ScreenFlow’s built-in editor offers a familiar nonlinear workspace where clips can be trimmed, layered, animated, and enhanced. It includes advanced features such as callouts, annotations, text overlays, transitions, chroma keying, audio cleanup, and motion effects. Users can highlight cursor actions, add touch callouts, create zoom-and-pan animations, and refine timing with frame-level precision.

ScreenFlow also supports exporting in multiple formats optimized for web, mobile, social media, and professional delivery. From 4K exports and custom codecs to built-in YouTube, Vimeo, and platform-ready presets, it provides flexible output options for every workflow. The app’s performance is optimized for macOS, ensuring smooth editing even with long or complex recordings.

Whether you’re producing online courses, software demonstrations, marketing content, or video guides, ScreenFlow brings together the power of a full editing suite with the simplicity needed for fast production.
